ðŸš¨ Breaking Change: Renamed XsAI and Xsai to XSAI

Weâ€™ve renamed the XsAI and Xsai classes to XSAI to keep naming consistent across the framework.

What changed?

If youâ€™re using the XsAIProvider or XsAIVoiceProvider, you now need to update your code to use XSAIProvider and XSAIVoiceProvider.

Before:

```ts
import { XsAIVoiceProvider } from "@voltagent/voice";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Asistant",
  description: "A helpful assistant that answers questions without using tools",
  llm: new XsAIProvider({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
  }),
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
});

const voiceProvider = new XsAIVoiceProvider({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

After:

```ts
import { XSAIVoiceProvider } from "@voltagent/voice";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Asistant",
  description: "A helpful assistant that answers questions without using tools",
  llm: new XSAIProvider({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
  }),
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
});

const voiceProvider = new XSAIVoiceProvider({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

This change resolves [#140](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/140).
